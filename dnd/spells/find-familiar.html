            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: <strong><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/monster/bat">Bat</a>, <a href="https://www.aidedd.org/monster/cat">Cat</a>, <a href="https://www.aidedd.org/monster/frog">Frog</a>, <a href="https://www.aidedd.org/monster/hawk">Hawk</a>, <a href="https://www.aidedd.org/monster/lizard">Lizard</a>, <a href="https://www.aidedd.org/monster/octopus">Octopus</a>, <a href="https://www.aidedd.org/monster/owl">Owl</a>, <a href="https://www.aidedd.org/monster/rat">Rat</a>, <a href="https://www.aidedd.org/monster/raven">Raven</a>, <a href="https://www.aidedd.org/monster/spider">Spider</a>, <a href="https://www.aidedd.org/monster/weasel">Weasel</a></strong>, or another Beast that has a Challenge Rating of 0. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands.<br/>Telepathic Connection. While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can see through the familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.<br/>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.<br/>Combat. The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.<br/>Disappearance of the Familiar. When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a Magic action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.<br/>One Familiar Only. You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.<br/></p>
