            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a Cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration.<br/>When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any of the following properties:<br/>• Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.<br/>• The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including Dark vision) through it.<br/>• Sensors created by Divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.<br/>• Creatures in the area can't be targeted by Divination spells.<br/>• Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.<br/>• Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.<br/>Casting this spell on the same spot every day for 365 days makes the spell last until dispelled.<br/><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot</em></strong>. You can increase the size of the Cube by 100 feet for each spell slot level above 4.<br/></p>
