            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>You create an Invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The intangible, invulnerable sensor remains in place for the duration.<br/>When you cast the spell, choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As a Bonus Action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.<br/>A creature that sees the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from <em><a href="./see-invisibility">See Invisibility</a></em> or Truesight) sees a luminous orb about the size of your fist.<br/></p>
