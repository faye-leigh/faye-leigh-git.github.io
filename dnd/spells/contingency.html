            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Choose a spell of level 5 or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of an action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting <em>Contingency</em>, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain trigger occurs. You describe that trigger when you cast the two spells. For example, a <em>Contingency</em> cast with <em>Water Breathing</em> might stipulate that Water Breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.<br/>The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the trigger occurs for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then <em>Contingency</em> ends.<br/>The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one <em>Contingency</em> spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another <em>Contingency</em> spell on you ends. Also, <em>Contingency</em> ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.<br/></p>
