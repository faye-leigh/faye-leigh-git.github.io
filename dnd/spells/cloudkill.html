            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of yellow-green fog centered on a point within range. The fog lasts for the duration or until strong wind (such as the one created by <em><a href="./gust-of-wind">Gust of Wind</a></em>) disperses it, ending the spell. Its area is Heavily Obscured.<br/><br/>Each creature in the Sphere makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d8 Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the Sphere moves into its space and when it enters the Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.<br/><br/>The Sphere moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns.<br/><br/><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot</em></strong>. The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 5.<br/><br/></p>
