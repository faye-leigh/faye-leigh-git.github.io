            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>You conjure a claw-footed cauldron filled with bubbling liquid. The cauldron appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you and lasts for the duration. The cauldron can't be moved, and disappears when the spell ends, along with the bubbling liquid inside of it.<br/>The liquid in the cauldron duplicates the properties of a Common or an Uncommon potion of your choice (such as <em>potion of healing</em>). As a Bonus Action, you or an ally can reach into the cauldron and withdraw one potion of that kind. The potion is contained in a vial that disappears when the potion is consumed. The cauldron can produce a number of these potions equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1). When the last of these potions is withdrawn from the cauldron, the cauldron disappears, and the spell ends.<br/>Potions obtained from the cauldron that aren't consumed disappear when you cast the spell again.<br/></p>
