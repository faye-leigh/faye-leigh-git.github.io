            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>You touch up to four nonmagical Arrows or Bolts and plant them in the ground in your space. Until the spell ends, the ammunition can't be physically uprooted, and whenever a creature other than you enters a space within 30 feet of the ammunition for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, one piece of ammunition flies up to strike it. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d4 Piercing damage. The piece of ammunition is then destroyed. The spell ends when none of the ammunition remains planted in the ground.<br/>When you cast this spell, you can designate any creatures you choose, and the spell ignores them.<br/><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot</em></strong>. The amount of ammunition that can be affected increases by two for each spell slot level above 2.<br/></p>
