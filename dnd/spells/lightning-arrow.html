            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>As your attack hits or misses the target, the weapon or ammunition you're using transforms into a lightning bolt. Instead of taking any damage or other effects from the attack, the target takes 4d8 Lightning damage on a hit or half as much damage on a miss. Each creature within 10 feet of the target then makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.<br/><br/>The weapon or ammunition then returns to its normal form.<br/><br/><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot</em></strong>. The damage for both effects of the spell increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3.<br/><br/></p>
