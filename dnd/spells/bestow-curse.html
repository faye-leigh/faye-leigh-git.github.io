            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>You touch a creature, which must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration. Until the curse ends, the target suffers one of the following effects of your choice:<br/>• Choose one ability. The target has Disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability.<br/>• The target has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you.<br/>• In combat, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or be forced to take the Dodge action on that turn.<br/>• If you deal damage to the target with an attack roll or a spell, the target takes an extra 1d8 Necrotic damage.<br/><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot</em></strong>. If you cast this spell using a level 4 spell slot, you can maintain Concentration on it for up to 10 minutes. If you use a level 5+ spell slot, the spell doesn't require Concentration, and the duration becomes 8 hours (level 5-6 slot) or 24 hours (level 7-8 slot). If you use a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled.<br/></p>
