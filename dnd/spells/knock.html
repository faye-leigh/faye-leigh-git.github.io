            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.<br/>A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.<br/>If the target is held shut by <em>Arcane Lock</em>, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and closed.<br/>When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible up to 300 feet away, emanates from the target.<br/></p>
