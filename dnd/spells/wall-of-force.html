            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>An Invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a globe with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick and lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side).<br/><br/>Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by <em><a href="https://www.aidedd.org/spell/dispel-magic">Dispel Magic</a></em>. A <em>Disintegrate</em> spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane and blocks ethereal travel through the wall.<br/><br/></p>
