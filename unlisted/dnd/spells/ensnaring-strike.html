            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>As you hit the target, grasping vines appear on it, and it makes a Strength saving throw. A Large or larger creature has Advantage on this save. On a failed save, the target has the Restrained condition until the spell ends. On a successful save, the vines shrivel away, and the spell ends.<br/>While Restrained, the target takes 1d6 Piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. The target or a creature within reach of it can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends.<br/><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot</em></strong>. The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.<br/></p>
