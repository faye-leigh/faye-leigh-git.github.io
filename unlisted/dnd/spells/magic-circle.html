            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall Cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the Cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.<br/>Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:<br/>• The creature can't willingly enter the Cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.<br/>• The creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the Cylinder.<br/>• Targets within the Cylinder can't be possessed by or gain the Charmed or Frightened condition from the creature.<br/>Each time you cast this spell, you can cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the Cylinder and protecting targets outside it.<br/><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot</em></strong>. The duration increases by 1 hour for each spell slot level above 3.<br/></p>
